### Hangman

`hangman.cs` is a simple hangman game that I wrote in C#. `hangman_impossible.py` is an advanced (read: cheating) version of hangman where the solution changes based on user input to make it as time consuming as possible to guess the word while still being consistent within the rules. The words are taken from the `words.txt` file which can also be found in this directory.
