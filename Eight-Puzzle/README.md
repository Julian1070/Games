### Eight-Puzzle

This code comes from an assignment I did for a class in artificial intelligence. It solves the 8-puzzle and larger variants. The output of this specific python file is a table comparing the performance of different heuristic functions (e.g. Manhattan-distance) on different configurations of the initial board.
